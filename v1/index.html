<title>SNON &mdash; the Sensor Network Object Notation</title>

<xmp theme="united" style="display:none;">
## Introducing SNON

SNON (Sensor Network Object Notation) is a lightweight sensor data representation for interchange and storage. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is highly compressible to reduce storage and network usage. SNON is based on the [JSON](http://json.org/), which is supported by most platforms and programming languages.

SNON is sensor independent, and uses conventions familiar to programmers who have worked with common sensor platforms. It is self-describing and extensible, with  features only required when needed. These properties make SNON ideal for delivery of sensor data over [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/), summarization of sensor data, and efficient storage in NoSQL and columnar databases.

## How is SNON Used?

SNON sits at the presentation layer in the OSI protocol stack. A typical SNON deployment involves:

* One or more sensors from which data is collected
* One or more gateways, which manage one or more sensors
* One or more aggregation points, which collect sensor data
* One or more storage systems, which persist sensor data
* One or more analytics engines, which process sensor data

SNON defines the data format used to transfer sensor data between these entities.

| SNON Data Flow        |           |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| ![SNON Data Flow](snon_flow.png)      | <br>SNON data starts out as physical values that are to be measured by sensors.<br><br>Each type of physical value has characteristics, such as the unit of measurement.<br><br>Sensors measure these physical values, and introduce additional characteristics.<br><br>Examples include the time of measurement, uncertainty of measurement, and location of measurement.<br><br>Sensor data is managed by gateways, which control data acquisition and transmission.<br><br>Sensor gateways collect the sensor data into SNON format in preparation for transmission.<br><br>An example of a transmission protocol well suited for SNON is MQTT.<br><br><br><br>SNON is designed to simplify real-time post-processing of sensor data.<br><br>Examples of post processing include quantization, summarization, filtering, and multi-sensor fusion.<br><br>Once processed, the resulting derived values can again be represented in SNON, and forwarded on to later processing elements.<br><br><br><br>When sensor data is aggregated and consolidated, it is simple to store in NoSQL and columnar databases.<br><br>SNON data has unique identifiers for sensor values and sources, which facilitate query.<br><br>Finally, since SNON data is self-describing, query and user interfaces can be dynamically generated.<br><br><br>Thus, by using a standard sensor data representation, complexity is reduced and systems are quicker to develop. |

## The SNON Representation

SNON defines the data interchanged between entities within a sensor network.

Each SNON message contains the following JSON data:

| Field Name<br>(Short Name)    | Data Type     | Description   | Mandatory |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | --------- |
| messageID<br>(msID)     | JSON String   | Globally unique identifier of the SNON message.<br><br>Uniquely identifies the message, allowing identification of duplicates.<br><br>Each globally unique identifier shall be no longer than 64 unicode characters in UTF-8 format (128 bytes). | Mandatory |

## SNON Examples

Example 1: A value from a temperature sensor:

    {
        "messageID": "F3461B2D-133F-4F40-AA0E-A1109F6FB8B2",
        "sensorID": "9A6D9328-C504-47D8-990A-6635D6268B49",
        "sensorName": "Temperature",
        "measureType" : "numeric",
        "measureAcquire" : "sample",
        "measureUnit" : "degree Celsius",
        "value" : ["29.3"],
        "valueTime" : ["2014-08-20T14:32:56.125Z"]
    }

Example 2: A second value from the same temperature sensor:

    {
        "messageID": "8F2DE720-F3E2-4B35-88F8-63A1B2D312B7",
        "precedentID": "F3461B2D-133F-4F40-AA0E-A1109F6FB8B2",
        "value" : ["28.8"],
        "valueTime" : ["2014-08-20T14:32:57.126Z"]
    }

This message refers back to the message in example 1, allowing a more compact representation by omitting fields that have not changed.

Example 3: Compact form of Example 2:

    {"msID":"8F2DE720-F3E2-4B35-88F8-63A1B2D312B7","pID":"F3461B2D-133F-4F40-AA0E-A1109F6FB8B2","v":["28.8"],"vt":["2014-08-20T14:32:57.126Z"]}

Example 4: A summary of a minute's worth of values from a temperature sensor:

    {
        "messageID": "2DC24B21-D37F-4282-BF60-F938274A7681",
        "sensorID": "9A6D9328-C504-47D8-990A-6635D6268B49",
        "sensorName": "Temperature",
        "measureType" : "numeric",
        "measureAcquire" : "summary",
        "measureUnit" : "degree Celsius",
        "value" : ["28.0"],
        "valueMax" : ["29.1"],
        "valueMin" : ["27.5"],
        "valueTime" : ["2014-08-20T14:33Z-2014-08-20T14:34Z"]
    }

Example 5: A GPS sensor in an automobile:

    {
        "messageID": "9B89268D-9AEF-4EDD-A67B-7C8A01114270",
        "sensorID": "49A0FD35-4913-4E83-BB07-7630E91B2CD6",
        "sensorName": "GPS Location",
        "measureType" : "enumeration",
        "measureAcquire" : "sample",
        "measureLabel" : [{"value":"0", "label":"Unlocked"}, {"value":"1", "label":"Locked"}],
        "value" : ["1"],
        "valuelocation" : ["4200.672,173.667,4780.3"],
        "valueTime" : ["2014-08-20T14:32:57.126Z"]
    }

Example 6: A heading sensor on the rear-view mirror of an automobile:

    {
        "messageID": "FB59762B-FB1A-408F-A17E-F219AAB7C27A",
        "sensorID": "BCEC6AC5-BB4B-44C4-8BF8-A414E5BDD096",
        "sensorName": "RVM-Heading",
        "measureType" : "numeric",
        "measureAcquire" : "sample",
        "measureUnit" : "radian",
        "value" : ["48.4"],
        "valuelocation" : ["0.453,0.240,0.012"],
        "valuelocationAngle" : ["46.21,10.22"],
        "valuelocationParent" : "9B89268D-9AEF-4EDD-A67B-7C8A01114270",
        "valueTime" : ["2014-08-20T14:32:57.126Z"]
    }

The location of the sensor is fixed relative to the location of the car.

## SNON and MQTT

Connecting to a MQTT broker:

* Each time a SNON sensor connects to a MQTT broker, the first SNON message sent shall be a sensor description message, with all value fields omitted, with a topic of "snon/announce". This permits discovery of SNON messages.
* Each time a SNON sensor reconnects to a MQTT broker, for each defined sensor, the value of the valueSession shall be increased.

Publishing SNON messages:

* When an SNON message is published via MQTT, the topic of "snon/sensorID" shall be used, where sensorID is replaced with the sensorID value of the SNON message. This allows interested parties to subscribe to each individual SNON message.
* The first non-announce SNON message published shall not include a precedentID.
* When SNON messages are sent with a precedentID, it is recommended that a SNON message without precedentID be periodically be sent to allow clients to being processing the sensor message stream.

## SNON Security

Sensor data often must be encrypted to protect confidentiality, and signed to protect integrity and demonstrate the authenticity of the source of the data. SNON uses JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) as described in [RFC 7516](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516) and [RFC 7515](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515). Each SNON message is used as the plaintext.

Example from [RFC 7520](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7520#section-5.6) of what an AES-GCM encrypted SNON message looks like using JWE:

    {
        "protected": "eyJhbGciOiJkaXIiLCJraWQiOiI3N2M3ZTJiOC02ZTEzLT
            Q1Y2YtODY3Mi02MTdiNWI0NTI0M2EiLCJlbmMiOiJBMTI4R0NNIn0",
        "iv": "refa467QzzKx6QAB",
        "ciphertext": "JW_i_f52hww_ELQPGaYyeAB6HYGcR559l9TYnSovc23XJ
            oBcW29rHP8yZOZG7YhLpT1bjFuvZPjQS-m0IFtVcXkZXdH_lr_FrdYt9

        "tag": "vbb32Xvllea2OtmHAdccRQ"
    }

Example from [RFC 7520](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7520#section-4.4) of what an HMAC-SHA2 signed SNON message looks like using JWS:

    {
        "payload": "SXTigJlzIGEgZGFuZ2Vyb3VzIGJ1c2luZXNzLCBGcm9kbywg
            Z29pbmcgb3V0IHlvdXIgZG9vci4gWW91IHN0ZXAgb250byB0aGUgcm9h
            ZCwgYW5kIGlmIHlvdSBkb24ndCBrZWVwIHlvdXIgZmVldCwgdGhlcmXi
            gJlzIG5vIGtub3dpbmcgd2hlcmUgeW91IG1pZ2h0IGJlIHN3ZXB0IG9m
            ZiB0by4",
        "protected": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjAxOGMwYWU1LTRkOW
            ItNDcxYi1iZmQ2LWVlZjMxNGJjNzAzNyJ9",
        "signature": "s0h6KThzkfBBBkLspW1h84VsJZFTsPPqMDA7g1Md7p0"
    }

Nesting of signatures and encryption is defined in section 6 of [RFC 7520](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7520#section-6).

Since Sensor IDs are used as MQTT topic names, it is strongly recommended that these be opaque (or hashes) to ensure that information is not leaked. This is why hierachical topic names are not used, as this will leak relationship data between sensors.
